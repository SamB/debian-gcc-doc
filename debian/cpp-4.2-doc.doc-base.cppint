Title: Internals of the GNU C preprocessor, version 4.2
Author: Various
Abstract: This brief manual documents the internals of cpplib, and
 explains some of the tricky issues.  It is intended that, along with
 the comments in the source code, a reasonably competent C programmer
 should be able to figure out what the code is doing, and why things
 have been implemented the way they have.
