 space for the package's maintainers, since they are already included
 in the main gcc packages.
Comment:
 This package is not part of the Debian distribution due to the use of
 GFDL "invariant sections" and "cover texts". See the explanation at
 <http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001#amendmenttexta>.
