 space for the Debian package maintainers, since they are already
 included in the main gcc packages.
Comment:
 This package is not part of the Debian distribution due to the use of
 GFDL "Invariant Sections" and "Cover Texts". See the explanation at
 <http://www.debian.org/vote/2006/vote_001#amendmenttexta>.

 These patches are automatically converted from the main GCC source
 package (gcc-X.Y). They SHOULD (but probably do not yet) contain
 copyright metadata in their headers.
License: XXX
 These patches need to declare their own copyright/licensing status
 somehow, and there needs to be a way to say so in DEP5.
