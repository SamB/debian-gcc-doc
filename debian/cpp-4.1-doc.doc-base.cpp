Title: The GNU C preprocessor, version 4.1
Author: Various
Abstract: The C preprocessor is a "macro processor" that is used automatically
 by the C compiler to transform your program before actual compilation.
 It is called a macro processor because it allows you to define "macros",
 which are brief abbreviations for longer constructs.
