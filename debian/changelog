gcc-4.1-doc-non-dfsg (4.1.1.nf2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Redone packaging, so man pages are also built from source.
  * Fixed package descriptions to mention that documents are not just GFDL,
    but contain invariant sections.
  * Added script to convert patches from debian gcc package to form
    suitable for this package.
  * Using that script, added patches from debian gcc-4.1 4.1.1ds1-14
  * Those patches superseed pathes that I've manually added in the
    previous version of the package, so removed my versions.
  * Added preinst scripts that remove old symlink to doc/gcc-4.1-base
    (Closes: #390093).
  * Not adding more documentation packages in this release, so upload
    will not get to NEW.
