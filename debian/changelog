gcc-4.6-doc (4.6.3-1~naesten7) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Fix the links between HTML manuals.
    + Use /usr/share/doc/gcc-X.Y-doc for all packages except gcc-doc-base,
      since we can't use @xref between directories.
    + Stop linking to (e.g.) gcc-4.6.html; the file is named gcc.html!
    + Update the *.doc-base* files for the new paths.
  * Unfortunately, many cross-references involving the GNAT *info* files
    have been broken for a while (probably at least since the docs got
    kicked out of gcc-X.Y proper for being non-free).  (This is arguably a
    bug in the rename-info-files.patch from the gcc-X.Y packages.)

gcc-4.6-doc-non-dfsg (4.6.2-1~naesten5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

    + Update debian/extract-doc-tarball-from-upstream to include the
      needed files in .orig tarballs.
  * Simplify README.source using the "get-orig-source" rule, and assuming
    that anyone trying to update the package to a new upstream version
    will be working in git.
  * debian/rules, debian/extract-doc-tarball-from-upstream:
    + Update for impending rename (of source package) to gcc-X.Y-doc.
    + Set mtime=0 in gzip header, so tarballs are reproducible.

    + Set myself as Maintainer, remove Uploaders field.

    However, documentation will eventially become out of sync, so

  * Set urgency to high, because etch currently does not have
    gcc docs at all, and this does hurt people.

    previous version of the package, so removed my versions.
  * Added preinst scripts that remove old symlink to doc/gcc-4.1-base
    (Closes: #390093).
  * Not adding more documentation packages in this release, so upload
    will not get to NEW.
