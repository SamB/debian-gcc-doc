gcc-4.1-doc-non-dfsg (4.1.1.nf3-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rebiuld .orig.tar.gz, to include gpl.7, gfdl.7, and fsf-funding.7
    man pages.
  * New binary package gcc-doc-base that provides these manpages.
    Closes: #389075.
  * Resync debian gcc patches, using gcc-4.1 4.1.1sd1-15.
    Closes: #389076.
    However, documentation will eventially become out of sync, so
    resync should be done after each gcc-4.1 package upload.
  * Set urgency to high, because etch currently does not have
    gcc docs at all, and this does hurt people.
  * Enough for today :).

gcc-4.1-doc-non-dfsg (4.1.1.nf2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Redone packaging, so man pages are also built from source.
  * Fixed package descriptions to mention that documents are not just GFDL,
    but contain invariant sections.
  * Added script to convert patches from debian gcc package to form
    suitable for this package.
  * Using that script, added patches from debian gcc-4.1 4.1.1ds1-14
  * Those patches superseed pathes that I've manually added in the
    previous version of the package, so removed my versions.
  * Added preinst scripts that remove old symlink to doc/gcc-4.1-base
    (Closes: #390093).
  * Not adding more documentation packages in this release, so upload
    will not get to NEW.
